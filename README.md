Time to stop acting as members of the elite, here is my answer to you, Scratch haters

Ik that you're used to send this famous github file, "why Scratch sucks" and since i'm too lazy to educate you, here is a list of possible issues you
have with Scratch, and why you're the only one to care. I'll explain what Scratch made of great for the programming community. Also i'm 
ukrainian, so sorry about my english grammar 

LIMITATIONS ON WHAT YOU CAN DO
  - Limitations ? Oh yeah the software is limited. But what aren't you able to do ? The software is upgraded at every update, and plugins are adding a lot of possibilites.
  Sure you'll never be totally free, but you're not in javascript too. Most peoples arguing about stuff you can't do with Scratch are taking examples of complex things
  they couldn't make alone with classic coding. Because you can't don't mean that you need to or want to, i'm tired of seeing "yEah bUt yOu cAn'T mAkE thiS tHinG yOu
  dOn'T nEed". Because i can't do something don't mean that i'm limited if i have no need for it.
  - Most haters are also refering to old Scratch versions, when, with recents updates, a LOT of stuff was added. Also yeah the software isn't making everything possible, 
  but it's totally possibly to fully lock your workspace to edit your code as you like too. Lots of users use locked code to tweak or add small features the software 
  don't, and there is no issue with it.
  
OVER-SIMPLIFIES CODE
  - This point in the original file really resume the issue with the Scratch haters. They are seeing themself as some Elite menaced by "the lose of skill and knowledge
  required to program with Scratch". You're refusing modernity and feeling endangered by the apparition of a software allowing everyone to make something you spent a lot
  of time in. You're refusing the accessibility cuz you want to avoid competition, because you know that a day will come where your "skills and knowledge" will have been
  replaced, and only creativity will matter. And this day, you don't know if you'll be able to stay on your throne.
  It's like complaining of "Blender is making me shine less as a 3D model make", yeah and ? Who cares, it helps, why would we like to learn modeling from
  code when we don't need to know everything to make what we want to.
  - "Yeah but because it's easy some peoples will stop javascript coding and instead continue using it when seeing how easier it is" From what i've seen, i've mainly seen
  peoples learning it when they wouldn't have started without Scratch being an introduction to programming. Lots of peoples using Scratch learn progressively a bit of javascript
  or completly switch, peoples staying to Scratch simply don't learn javascript because they never wanted to in the first place, the "peoples stopping learning javascript because
  of Scratch" are a myth, they don't exist or never truely wanted to learn it.
 -  I also see some haters saying "It's useless for programming". Then why did i saw multiple times devs looking at the way Scratch is adding some stuff to implement it ?
  Or many famous developpers or teams using it as a way to create sketchs of ideas or concepts (Google, Meta, etc) ? 
  I mean programmers NEVER check google to look at how to add something, they are borned with an infinite omniscient knowledge making them beings above us poor mortals
  - "It's not optimised" it's impossible for a software like this to be fully optimised and the performance impact is most of the time negligable. It used to be less
  optimised in older version, making it clearer, but most of the time the real impact is ridiculous or non-existant.
  - "It's for lazy people" Who are you to judge me ? Did i asked for your opinion on my life choices ?

ALLOWS FOR CRAPPY, GENERIC PROGRAMS
  - So Scratch invented unoriginal low quality programs ? Just take a look at some of the most popular old games. The only reason why they are popular today is because they are
  old and peoples grew with them, they are "iconic" but most of them are unoriginal af and have horrible assets. Yeah Scratch allowed low quality programs to be made easier,
  but what would it have been without ? In my opinion worth, but it's another more complex topic, and they are still bad javascript programs, that's a stupid point
  The software allowed players to create programs and games to play the way the would like to play, because you don't find them interesting don't mean that it's not the way they would 
  like to play the game. What's the issue with peoples doing small fun programs they enjoy working on or playing with ? Your goal isn't their goal, and i personnaly think 
  that the issue is on Steam/EA/Ubisoft/etc side, to not moderate the low effort / too similar content spam. I don't love this amount of objectively bad
  content but i'm nobody to judge what peoples enjoy if that's not flooding gaming websites, so originality should simply be a more important criteria on modding websites
  - It's also an introduction to programming, even if only 10, or 5, or even 1% end up doing great stuff, you never start by doing insane things. You try, learn and end up 
  doing great things.

MAKES DEVELOPERS THINK PROGRAMMING IS A SIMPLE PROCESS
  - Yeah basically this point was in the original file the creator complaining about how horrible it is to help peoples...
  - Also want to answer to everybody saying "huuUh Scratch programming iS liKe doiNg nOthiNg" no, you need to understand what you're doing, because you use blocks instead
  of sentences don't mean that it's doing everything for you by miracle. You sound like peoples criticizing Digital Art.

CLOSED-SYSTEM
  - This is outdated. You can now fully lock and edit the code if you're not satisfied of the generated one. Also complotism about "Scratch Dev Team" being evil...
  Ik some members of the staff and they are everything but diabolic, it's just a random pointless try to make Scratch look dangerous (fear sophism isn't a valid
  argument)

VERY HARD TO CATCH AND FIX ERRORS
  - Simply false. You most of the time get the procedure creating the issue, from a game dev perspective it's really easy to debug. If they have clear names, it's 
  easy to understand what's causing it. If you can't understand errors that i can interpret, you should question your "knowledge"...

HAVE TO BIDE BY THE PROGRAM'S TOS
  - Again some fear sophism, i mean that's the case for everything you use daily online... Stop using Github, Google, Discord

WHAT / WHO IS SCRATCH DESIGNED FOR?
  - Wait you're deciding who have the RIGHT to use a software ? Who are you thinking you are lmao ? 

EXCUSES THAT DO NOT WORK
  - That's crazy how much irrespect you can put in here xD Because you didn't touched grass when you were 12yo don't mean that everybody should. You know Scratch
  users can make life choices without being constantly harrased because you're considering them as lazy ?

OTHER
  "Scratch bad performance issue/broken/bugged" "Scratch is crashing more frequently / causing issues more frequently than real javascript webapps"
    -> It was probably used by someone not using the tool the right way. Blame the programmer, not the software. Scratch is a tool requiering some understanding of basic
       concepts like numbers or loops that many user could not understand properly, resulting in laggy programs.
  "The code is awful to read"
    -> Not in recent versions, if i can understand it with my limited javascript knowledge you're the issue
  "I used it, it was horrible to use / i had issues with it"
    -> You're the issue. Try to understand your errors, and how to use the software and its possibilities

WHAT SCRATCH CONTRIBUTED TO DO
  - Making more gamers interested in programming
  - Player who would have never started learning it wihtout Scratch learned it progressively when using custom code
  - Made Model Makers and Pixel Artists shine throught Scratch webapps, allowing them to create games, and eventually made them start pixel art in the first place
  - Helped peoples to enjoy their random games without having to learns tons of javascript
  - Makes it way easier to make mathematical stuff imo. Lot clearer to understand your complex equations
